# Database System Project: Midwifery Program

(This program is inspired by the Quebec Ministry of Health)

## Program senario:

The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused severe strain on the hospital systems across the world. The midwifery program is launched to ameliorate this issue: it allows pregnant couples to receive professional healthcare service from an assigned midwife, who is medically trained and certified.

## Project requirement:

The tasks of this project are to:

- Analyze the relationships between different objects, including midwives, couples, pregnancy, appointment, medical tests, technician, etc.
- Build relationship model and draw ER graph to present relationships between the above objects.
- Write SQL code to load, create, and drop data in dataset.
- Write a Java program to build an interactive program based on the relationship structure and data built earlier.
